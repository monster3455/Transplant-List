# Transplant-List
Created a organs transplant list taking in patient and saving to SQL database. The program allowed Adding, Modifying, Viewing and Deleting of the patients.

Working on
SQL queries and database connection a mess right now, need to consoladate to one database, and add primary and forgien keys to connect the tables.
This will also require a change in the queries.

Want to Add
Change UI to better suit increasing the ease of use and the amount of information that the program can work with.
